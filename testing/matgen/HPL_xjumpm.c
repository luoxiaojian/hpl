   * Purpose
   * =======
   *
   * HPL_xjumpm computes  the constants  A and C  to jump JUMPM numbers in
   * the random sequence: X(n+JUMPM) = A*X(n)+C.  The constants encoded in
   * MULT and IADD  specify  how to jump from one entry in the sequence to
   * the next.
   *
   * Arguments
   * =========
   *
   * JUMPM   (local input)                 const int
   *         On entry,  JUMPM  specifies  the  number  of entries  in  the
   *         sequence to jump over. When JUMPM is less or equal than zero,
   *         A and C are not computed, IRANM is set to IRANN corresponding
   *         to a jump of size zero.
   *
   * MULT    (local input)                 int *
   *         On entry, MULT is an array of dimension 2,  that contains the
   *         16-lower  and 15-higher bits of the constant  a  to jump from
   *         X(n) to X(n+1) = a*X(n) + c in the random sequence.
   *
   * IADD    (local input)                 int *
   *         On entry, IADD is an array of dimension 2,  that contains the
   *         16-lower  and 15-higher bits of the constant  c  to jump from
   *         X(n) to X(n+1) = a*X(n) + c in the random sequence.
   *
   * IRANN   (local input)                 int *
   *         On entry, IRANN is an array of dimension 2. that contains the
   *         16-lower and 15-higher bits of the encoding of X(n).
   *
   * IRANM   (local output)                int *
   *         On entry,  IRANM  is an array of dimension 2.   On exit, this
   *         array  contains respectively  the 16-lower and 15-higher bits
   *         of the encoding of X(n+JUMPM).
   *
   * IAM     (local output)                int *
   *         On entry, IAM is an array of dimension 2. On exit, when JUMPM
   *         is  greater  than  zero,  this  array  contains  the  encoded
   *         constant  A  to jump from  X(n) to  X(n+JUMPM)  in the random
   *         sequence. IAM(0:1)  contains  respectively  the  16-lower and
   *         15-higher  bits  of this constant  A. When  JUMPM  is less or
   *         equal than zero, this array is not referenced.
   *
   * ICM     (local output)                int *
   *         On entry, ICM is an array of dimension 2. On exit, when JUMPM
   *         is  greater  than  zero,  this  array  contains  the  encoded
   *         constant  C  to jump from  X(n)  to  X(n+JUMPM) in the random
   *         sequence. ICM(0:1)  contains  respectively  the  16-lower and
   *         15-higher  bits  of this constant  C. When  JUMPM  is less or
   *         equal than zero, this array is not referenced.
