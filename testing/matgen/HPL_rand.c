   * Purpose
   * =======
   *
   * HPL_rand generates  the next number  in the  random  sequence.  This
   * function  ensures  that this number lies in the interval (-0.5, 0.5].
   *
   * The static array irand contains the information (2 integers) required
   * to generate the  next number  in the sequence  X(n).  This  number is
   * computed as X(n) = (2^32 * irand[1] + irand[0]) / d - 0.5,  where the
   * constant d is the largest 64 bit positive unsigned integer. The array
   * irand is then  updated  for the generation of the next number  X(n+1)
   * in  the  random   sequence  as   follows  X(n+1) = a * X(n) + c.  The
   * constants a and c should have been preliminarily stored in the arrays
   * ias and ics as 2 pairs of integers.  The initialization of  ias,  ics
   * and  irand  is performed by the function HPL_setran.
